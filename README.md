## hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Shubhayu Shrestha and I am a Full Stack Engineer and an MSCS Student at UT Austin! I recently graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington in December 2022 where I studied Software Engineering. I formerly worked as an Undergraduate Researcher at UTA's Heracleia lab, as a Full Stack Engineer Intern at Lockheed Martin, and most recently, as a Full Stack Engineer at Fidelity Investments. I have a strong passion for programming, problem solving, game development, and UI/UX design and I love being able to apply those skills on large scale projects! Welcome to my GitHub page!

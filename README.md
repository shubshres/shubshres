### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Junior at the University of Texas at Arlington and am expecting to graduate in Fall 2022. I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher at UTA's Heracleia lab where I have worked with ROS Kinetic and have assisted PhD Students in their research and am also an incoming System Integration Engineer Intern at Lockheed Martin. I love coding and problem solving and being able to work on projects that I am able to use every day! Welcome to my GitHub page!
